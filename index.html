                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div>
				<p>My name is Ciaran Skelly, I am 18 years old. I live in Lusk, Co.Dublin. I attended Lusk Community College for my second level education.  I am now studying Computer Applications at Dublin City University. I chose to do computer applications at DCU because I enjoyed learning how to build my own computer for playing games. I wanted to learn more about computers and how they work. I found it interesting learning the little bit of programming I had done before I started computer applications. I have a lot of hobbies, some of which include music and playing video games. I am currently learning how to play guitar, using mainly youtube videos because of the pandemic making it more difficult to get a guitar teacher. </p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <div>
				 <p>On my previous work experience when I was in sixth year, I worked on a farm near to where I live called <a href="http://taylorsoflusk.ie/">Taylorâ€™s of Lusk</a> as a summer job.  I worked for roughly two months. Most of the time I was in the sheds prepping vegetables however, there were a number of times I worked in the fields. My typical duties included:</p>
                 <ul>
                  <li> Prepping and weighing broccoli</li>
                  <li> Packing broccoli into boxes</li>
                  <li> Going into the greenhouses and picking chillies</li> 
                  <li> Packing and labelling chillies</li>
                  <li> Going into the field and harvesting garlic</li>
                 </ul>
                <p> From the work experience I did it was clear that I have no interest in pursuing a future career in this sector as I found it to be quite repetitive and boring. I do still think that the work experience was beneficial to me for the general work experience though. I also learned the importance of clear communication because there were a number of issues that arose during my time there, on multiple occasions I did not know what I was supposed to be doing and I had to ask for clarification.</p>
